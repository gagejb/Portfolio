Twitter Bootstrap/Kendo UI Example
---------------------------------------

This is a simple combination of the Kendo UI Grid functionality with the Twitter Bootstrap UI framework. The data 
is in JSON format and is stored in a separate data-file (also included in the project). A few points of interest:

* The main page that reflects this work is "index.html" and is offered for review and use (see note below).
* This implementation is using LESS; therefore the index.html file will not render correctly if viewed from the file system
via a browser. My suggestion is to deploy the files in this project to a web-server (e.g. Apache, IIS). Also, I have included 
all of the Bootstrap-relevant .less files in this project so that the "variables.less" file would import all less files correctly. 
* I have tested this page in Chrome, Firefox and Safari.
